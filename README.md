# XDragUpMenu
 
A pull-up menu with a translucent, blurred background that supports the navigation controller and can follow the touch gesture to rise or fall. When this menu is pulled up to a certain extent, it can automatically hover over the top, and when it is pulled down to a certain extent, it can automatically disappear from the bottom.
